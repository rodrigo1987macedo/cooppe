###REMEMBER###

As a convention, everything in javascript is named using camelCase notation, with the important exeption of the <ReactComponent /> which introduces a variation, starting with an uppercase instead of a lowercase.

----------

###UPDATE ANY SECTION FROM A CERTAIN CITY###

1- update "HTML" content in src/database/(CITY)/text/(SECTION).

CITY example: /losAngeles
SECTION example: thingsToDoLosAngeles.js

----------

###ADD NEW INNER CONTENT PAGE###

1- create javascript file (ExampleComponenet.js) in src/database/(CITY)/text/(CITY_INNER_CONTENT)/(SECTION_INNER_CONTENT_FOLDER)/(SECTION_INNER_CONTENT)/urls/.

CITY example: /losAngeles
SECTION example: thingsToDoLosAngeles.js
CITY_INNER_CONTENT example: /inLosAngeles
CITY_INNER_CONTENT_FOLDER example: /thingsToDoLosAngeles
SECTION_INNER_CONTENT example: thingsToDoLosAngeles.js

2- import exampleComponenet from "./urls/ExampleComponent" in src/database/(CITY)/text/(CITY_INNER_CONTENT)/(SECTION_INNER_CONTENT_FOLDER)/(SECTION_INNER_CONTENT)/.

3- add the (export default exampleComponent) from previously created javascript file in (const exampleArray = [example1, example2, example]) in the same file as the step above.

----------

###USE CARTOGRAPHY COMPONENT###

1- create javascript file (geoJSONfile.js) in src/database/(CITY)/gejson, si a good practice to name this file as the url is going to be in, if there are two maps, just name the other with a 2 after.

2- import geoJSONComponenet from "../../../../geojson/geoJSONComponenet" in src/database/(CITY)/text/(CITY_INNER_CONTENT)/(SECTION_INNER_CONTENT_FOLDER)/(SECTION_INNER_CONTENT).

3- use the component inside the "HTML" in the same file as the step above.
