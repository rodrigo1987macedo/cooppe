      it for the colorful fun you will find on the street. Bargain hunters will
      find great vintage clothes. Many small stores sell alternative clothes,
      shoes and accessories. The most convenient way to get here is to take{" "}

    <h3>Union Street</h3>
    <Paragraph>
      While often confused by visitors with Union Square it provides very
      different shopping experience. Its beauty is the Victorian architecture of
      the small trendy shops. The area is known for jewelry stores and
      goldsmiths. There are about 400 shops, restaurants and businesses between
      Steiner and Gough Streets along Union Street. Many shops can also be found
      at each of the cross streets. Another strongly populated area of shops
      nearby is on Fillmore between Union Street and Lombard Street. The easy
      way to get here is to take bus #45 at Stockton and Sutter Streets near
      Union Square or bus #41 (commute hours only) at Washington Street and
      Columbus Avenue from the Financial District.
