      The Tenderloin with a large population of homeless people, drug addicts
      and prostitutes, close to the popular tourist destination Union Square,
      has a reputation as the most dangerous area of San Francisco. You should
      avoid it, especially at night. Crowded areas are often targeted by
      pickpockets and panhandlers. Keep an eye on your belongings and don’t keep
      wallets or expensive electronic devices where they can be easily stolen.
      Another area where you may notice open drug use and homeless camps is
      Mission. In case you’re confronted by someone avoid eye contact and keep
      walking. Cars are sometimes broken into, so don't leave any valuables.
      Make sure you know what to do in case of an earthquake. Small ones are
      common here.
