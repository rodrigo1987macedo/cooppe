    <Paragraph>
      San Francisco is a relatively small city so where you stay is not as
      important as in some bigger cities. Having good access to public
      transportation is always a plus. Following are the most popular areas for
      accommodation.
    </Paragraph>
    <h3>Fisherman's Wharf</h3>
    <Paragraph>
      This area is mostly inhabited by tourists and locals don't consider it the
      "real" city. There are plenty of souvenir shops and most restaurants are
      tourist oriented. It has nice views of the bay and North Beach is within
      walking distance. Alcatraz ferries, Girhardelli Square and Pier 39 are all
      here. It is quite safe and lively with tourists every day so it might be a
      good choice for families traveling with young kids.
    </Paragraph>
    <h3>Marina District</h3>
    <Paragraph>
      Many motels in this area are cheaper and simpler than the ones in other
      districts. Some have parking which is not common in the city. You get more
      of a typical San Francisco flavor around here. Wide variety of boutiques,
      restaurants, and buildings with unique architecture can be found along
      Lombard and Chestnut Streets.
    </Paragraph>
    <h3>South of Market (SoMa)</h3>
    <Paragraph>
      South of Market is a huge district from the Embarcadero to Eleventh
      Street, and between Market and Townsend. The neighborhood is a patchwork
      of warehouses, interesting nightspots, hotels, art spaces, loft
      apartments, and high tech companies. Some areas, like the zone around
      Sixth and Mission, can be sketchy. The western end of the district is the
      most industrial. Several of the city's arts organizations are located
      around Market and Third Street.
    </Paragraph>
    <h3>Tenderloin</h3>
    <Paragraph>
      Tenderloin is centrally located San Francisco neighborhood. It has lots of
      restaurants, bars and bakeries. Locals go there during the day and evening
      but many would avoid walking around late at night. There are homeless
      people in this area, but if you're used to urban grit, you'll be fine.
      This area is not for families with children.
    </Paragraph>
    <h3>The Embarcadero</h3>
    <Paragraph>
      This area is on the waterfront and next to the Financial District, so it's
      busy on work days. It is close to public transportation and the Ferry
      building which makes it easy to visit various locations in the city and
      around the bay. Many restaurants are around here. The Embarcadero is flat,
      so it is great for walking or jogging.
    </Paragraph>
    <h3>Union Square</h3>
    <Paragraph>
      This is the heart of the city where most business travelers stay. There
      are many designer and name-brand shops around and big department stores
      are close by. It is a center for transit and all other areas are easily
      traveled to. Many high end restaurants are here with fewer ethnic food
      choices. The theater district is nearby. Union Square is not as family
      oriented as other hotel areas. Gritty Tenderloin is right next to it which
      most locals avoid especially at night.
