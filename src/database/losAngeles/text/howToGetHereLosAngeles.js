      There are four freeways (Interstate 80, Interstate 280, Route 1 and Route
      101) within the city. Northward and eastward links are provided by the
      Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay Bridge. Both have tolls ONLY when driving
      into San Francisco. At the{" "}

      >
        Golden Gate Bridge
      </A>{" "}
      there are no toll booths or humans to collect the payment. You can pay the
      toll up to 30 days BEFORE crossing the bridge or UP TO 2 DAYS AFTER.
      Cameras on the bridge capture license plates and invoices are sent to the
      addresses on file with the Department of Motor Vehicles. There is an
      option to pay cash at the Golden Gate Bridge Visitor Center and some other
      locations but that's not very convenient because parking is challenging.
      If you are renting a car, ask the company about pay-by-plate option. They
      will bill you for the toll plus charge you a processing fee.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      AVOID arriving by car if you can. Driving around is difficult even during
      off peak hours. Parking is very expensive and at times, hard to find.
      Around most of the tourist areas it may cost up to $15 an hour. Parking
      along the roads is metered, often you need a permit. Sometimes parking is
      not allowed because of street cleaning and during rush hour periods.
      Overnight parking may cost up to $50 per night and in some cases without
      in/out privileges. Most hotels do not have lots. Public transportation is
      bay far the best way to get around.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      If you must arrive by car, try finding a hotel with parking included. Take
      a look at motels around Lombard Street.{" "}

      at Embarcadero, Montgomery, Powel or Civic Center stations. Using public
      transportation is easy, fast, cheap, and convenient. It helps a lot if
      your hotel is within walking distance from a station. If you are staying
      close to the airport, some hotels offer shuttle service. For groups of 3
      or more people it might be more cost effective to use one of many
